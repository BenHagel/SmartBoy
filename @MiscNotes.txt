Get measurable output - and track body juices w visual bars

Separate the lobes by the regular freq updater
-weight adjuster
-threshold adjuster


Input receiver's NN,
Health adjuster NN (weight)
Reputation adjuster NN (weight)

input_meta tracker (arrow keys in p5js to see it)
Test out more complex NN's output distributuoin (multi layerd?ED)

We're probably very close...

Just need to find the simplest set of rules i can define with additions and multiplications that define pattern recreation.

Health: how often your model is correct,
Reputation: how often your send-to PU is happy

Threshold changes (based on thes two^)
How much work did nature have to do to be left behind

Joshca, you had a lot of good ideas about consciouscenss and intelligence,
and you did all of that because you didn't have the brute force computational
power to offload all that thinking.  Just get the computer to guess numbers.
All that needs to be done is the set of rules that would encapsulate it...
